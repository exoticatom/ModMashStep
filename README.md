# ModMeshStep Plug-in
This plugin is made for CraftBeerPi3 to extend protective capabilities in regards to a problem which could occur with SSR when they fail (shortened).
In situation like that, mash can be cooked and destroyed.
This plugin adds new step called "Mod_MeshStep" to steps and for the implementation it is needed to have relay board (1 relay reserved) and high current circuit breaker (16+ A).
Plugin is only lightly modified base plugin for brewing step. In this version protection is relaying on the same sensor data as for the kettle which is being protected.

Idea is to introduce "Protective Circuit" which will, when triggered:
- stop brewing process, after which manual intervention to continue the brewing is needed (by reseting  current step or skipping to next one)
- showing remaining time when protections was activated.
- by activating protective circuit disconnect output of the SSR using for heating in order to protect the mash from higher temperature.

How to Config:
- Add an Actor which will act as protective circuit/relay. Typically one output of relay board.
- Add the Mod_MeshStep to your brewing steps:
    a) Configure  Protective circuit
    b) Configure temperature difference. (default is 8C)
- Connect high power breaker to your relay output and it's output contact in series to SSR relay. (Check schematics)

Additional info:
Temperature threshold is the temperature when protection will kick in and disconnect SSR output.
Threshold temperature = Temperature (for mashing) + temperature difference
